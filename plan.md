## Step 1: Clean the Data
- Remove duplicates
- Handle missing values


## Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Purpose: To understand the characteristics of IoT-23 (which is very different from CICIDS or NSL-KDD) and discover practical insights into IoT attack behavior.

## Step 3: Feature Engineering
- Create new features

## Step 4: Model selection & evaluation

## Step 5: Training, Tuning, and Testing

## Step 6: Visualization

## Step 7: Report Writing


Objectives:
- Supervised Learning
- Feature Selection
- Optimization
- Model Evaluation- Hyperparameter Tuning
